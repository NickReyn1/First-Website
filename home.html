                <p>Peanut's the head cat in the house. She's been around the block and knows how everything works! Even though she's getting up there in age she's still got quite a bit of pep in her step.</p>

                <h2>Babycats Profile</h2>
                <p>Babycat might not be that much of a baby anymore but she's still got that young cat curiosity. She's always looking for new things to explore and loves going outside to roll around in the sun. She also loves scratches and hates when something else is getting more attention than her.</p>
