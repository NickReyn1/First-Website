# First-Website

This project was mostly about getting exposure to HTML and CSS and going through the process of hosting a website online. The website is fairly bare-bones and only uses HTML and CSS. I also didn't spend a ton of time on the design of the website. 

I have been working on learning more javascript and I'll probably come back to this project fairly soon to clean up the html and css and add new things too it. The website can be accessed through https://peanutandbabycat.netlify.app/
